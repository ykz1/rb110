Requirements:
- Input: string
- Output: new string
- Operation: capitalize every second character of every third word

Solution overview:
- Iterate with index through words within given string -- use #map so we return a new array which we can re-join into a string with #join
- Iterate through characters within in each word
- Considerations:
  - What if less than 3 words?
  - What if words have less than two characters?
- Option 1: use #map and #join twiceâ€”one for each of our iterations
- Option 2: use #each_with_index for both iterations and if statement to change cases
- Option 3: iterate by our skips (i.e. every 2...every 3) and change only relevant characters. This is probably most efficient but difficult to implement
